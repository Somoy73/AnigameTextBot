# AnigameTextBot

This bot allows you to randomly type in messages while faking actual Key Presses, bypassing discord's security measures.
The bot will also automatically generate ".claim" command to claim cards when they appear and will also
stop the bot and warn the user when a Captcha Verification to prevent bots in discord comes up.
Aside from it's use in 'Anigame', this may come in useful for various Discord based games including games like Pokecord and such.
You can also normally spam random text or text from a premade .txt file on any site using this bot.
