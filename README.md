# AnigameTextBot

This bot allows you to randomly type in messages while faking actual Key Presses, bypassing discord's security measures.
The bot can automatically generate ".claim" command to claim cards when Anigame cards appear. 
The bot can also stop the bot and warn the user when a Captcha Verification to prevent bots in discord comes up.
Aside from automating 'Anigame', this may come in useful for various Discord based games including games like Pokecord and such.
You can also normally spam random text or text from a premade random.txt file on any site using this bot.
