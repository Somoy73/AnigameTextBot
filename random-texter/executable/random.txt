I don't wanna think about nothing
Just watching you dancing
Feel like the beginning of something
In the end, in the end
All I wanna do is just fall in
I don't wanna think about nothing
Everybody got so much to say
Every time we pushing away
Everyday, a new reason to stay
'Cause we got a big love
Won't ever give it up
We got a one-way ticket love
We ain't going no place but up
Nothing can stop this, no one can top us
We got a bigger love
I don't wanna think about nothing
The world feels like it's crumbling
Everyday, another new something
But in the end, in the end
Can't nobody do us in
I just wanna think about loving
'Cause we got a bigger love
Won't ever give it up
We got a one-way ticket love
We ain't going no place but up
Nothing can stop this, no one can top us
We got a bigger love
We got a bigger love
Won't ever give it up, no
We got a one-way ticket love
We ain't going no place but up
Nothing can stop this, no one can top us
Oh, we got a bigger love
Won't ever give it up
We got a one-way ticket love
We ain't going no place but up
Nothing can stop this, no one can top us
'Cause we got a bigger love
Oh, won't ever give it up, no
We got a one-way ticket love
We ain't going no place but up
Nothing can stop this, no one can top us
We got a bigger love

Let's have conversations in the dark
World asleep and I'm awake with you
With you
Watch
Movies that we've both already seen
I ain't even looking at the screen, it's true
I got my eyes on you
And you say that you're not worthy
You get hung up on your flaws
Well, in my eyes, you are perfect
As you are
I won't ever try to change you, change you
I will always want the same you, same you
Swear on everything I pray to
That I won't break your heart
I'll be there when you get lonely, lonely
Keep the secrets that you told me, told me
And your love is all you owe me
And I won't break your heart
On
Sunday mornings we sleep in till noon
Well, I can sleep forever next to you
Next to you
And we
We got places we both gotta be
But there ain't nothing I would rather do
Than blow off all my plans for you
And you say that you're not worthy
And get hung up on your flaws
But, in my eyes, you are perfect
As you are
As you are
I won't ever try to change you, change you
I will always want the same you, same you
Swear on everything I pray to
That I won't break your heart
I'll be there when you get lonely, lonely
Keep the secrets that you told me, told me
And your love is all you owe me
And I won't break your heart
When no one seems to notice
And your days, they seem so hard
My darling, you should know this
My love is everywhere you are
I won't ever try to change you, change you
I will always want the same you, same you
Swear on everything I pray to
That I won't break your heart
I'll be there when you get lonely, lonely
Keep the secrets that you told me, told me
And your love is all you owe me
And I won't break your heart
I won't break your heart
