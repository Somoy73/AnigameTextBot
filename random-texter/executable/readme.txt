You need to have the Latest Java Runtime Environment Installed to run this file. 
Make sure to put the "random.txt" file in the same folder as the Executable Jar file.
In case you do not put the random.txt file in the same folder the bot will randomly 
generate strings of length (0-50) instead of copy-pasting the lines in the random.txt file.

Good Luck Spamming ! ^_^)
